# storybook-nextjs

A setup run-thru of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) in a stock [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app

## Steps

### Next.js

[Instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs)

- run `npx create-next-app --ts --use-npm`
  - npm because i prefer it to yarn
  - typescript because i thought it might add a level of configuration complication
  - **This will create a new project directory. There isn't an `in-place` option.**
- `cd storybook-nextjs`
- `npm run dev`
- `visit http://localhost:3000`

### Storybook

[Instructions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install)

- run `npx sb init` _in_ project root
  - this makes sense whene there is an existing project (like this). it's not perfectly clear if I were using Storybook to build out a new, single component on design system
  - <mark>are there starters for projects like individual components and design systems for folks who want to use Storybook as their primary artifact?</mark>

> audited 1830 packages in 8.289s
> 236 packages are looking for funding
> run `npm fund` for details

> found 40 vulnerabilities (30 moderate, 10 high)
> run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details

- this feels like:
  - a LOT of dependencies
  - a lot of introduced vulnerabilities
- run `npm audit fix`
  - does not resolve vulnerabilities

> fixed 0 of 40 vulnerabilities in 1830 scanned packages
> 40 vulnerabilities required manual review and could not be updated

- `npm run storybook`
  - ‚úÖ works!
- documentation jumps directly into ["What's a story?"](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story)
  - because we used a generator, there are LOTS of new files. i think a document on the structure is warrented. even if just a link to another doc
  - items to cover
    - `.storybook`
      - `main.js`
      - `preview.js`
    - `stories`
      - `...stories`
      - `assets`
      - `introduction.mdx`
  - interesting time to cover the difference between stories and markdown
  - Component Story Format (CSF) should be a link to [docs/{library}/api/csf](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf)
  - `alt` tags for images are sparce
    - consider "Screenshot of Storybook in browser. The sidebar has Story Button/Primary selected. The main are of the site shows the "Canvas" tab with the rendered button"
  - slight divergance in documentation demo and generated code

_documentation_

```tsx
// Button.stories.ts | Button.stories.tsx

import React from "react";

import { Story, Meta } from "@storybook/react";

import { Button } from "./Button";

export default {
  component: Button,
  title: "Components/Button",
} as Meta;

//üëá We create a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù of how args map to rendering
const Template: Story<ButtonProps> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});

Primary.args = {
  primary: true,
  label: "Button",
};
```

_SB generated_

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ComponentStory, ComponentMeta } from "@storybook/react";

import { Button } from "./Button";

export default {
  title: "Example/Button",
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    backgroundColor: { control: "color" },
  },
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>;

const Template: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {
  primary: true,
  label: "Button",
};
```

- Setup a story outside of `/stories`
  - update config to include path
  - add story
  - restart server (not sure if this is always the case for config)
  - [include global css](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-rendering), link conveniently supplied
    - but there are no examples. kinda goes in a link loop
- Why don't I see type errors for `href` when attempting to use the component in a `.tsx` story?
- import `styles/globals.css` to `.storybook/preview.js`
- import `styles/Home.module.css` into `index.stories.tsx`
- no info here on CSS Modules
  - searched and got a lot of "Storybook CSS Modules don't work" hits
    - https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/12464
    - nothing on the [Styling and CSS](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/styling-and-css) page
    - [storybook-css-moudles-preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/storybook-css-modules-preset) is the first promising result
      - `npm install -D storybook-css-modules-preset`
      - `40 fvulnerabilities (30 moderate, 10 high)`
      - append `storybook-css-modules-preset` to `addons` in `./storybook/main.js`
      - works
      - if this is the preferred way, we should document it. if not, we should create a new package
  - static next assets aren't available

  - deferring to next commit
- At this point, I'm really curious if there could be some type of generator that would include story setup (which i end up copy-pasting)
- can we automatically create storybooks for anything in the /pages directory?

### Chromatic

- Login into Chromatic (create account)
- Choose Github option for selecting a project
- click on project
- see instructions
  - `npm install --save-dev chromatic`
  - `npx chromatic --project-token=1fd2615c5317`
    - questions:
      - is the token refreshable?
      - what happens if i accidentaly make my token public?
      - are there instructions for hiding the token?
      - how do i get back to this link again if i need it later?
        - [add options](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/cli)
        - [learn more](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/setup)
        - is there a way to have a "signed-in" version of these docs with the token (like Stripe)?
        - automation instructions?
        - talk about how this is the "baseline"?
        - reads more like it's just about publishing/hosting

- this was totally a failure on my end. not sure if the install failed, if i typed it wrong, or what. but chromatic didn't get installed and *this* was the problem

‚Ñπ Speed up Continuous Integration
Your project is linked to GitHub so Chromatic will report results there.
This means you can pass the --exit-once-uploaded flag to skip waiting for build results.
Read more here: https://www.chromatic.com/docs/cli#chromatic-options

‚úî Build passed. Welcome to Chromatic!
We found 5 components with 10 stories and took 10 snapshots.
‚Ñπ Please continue setup at https://www.chromatic.com/setup?appId=614a32227eef4b003adb8599

‚ö† No 'chromatic' script found in your package.json
Would you like me to add it for you? [y/N]
```

- all the links are absolutely incredible here!
- i have felt concerned about how to answer the question an the end without more details (as mentioned above)
  - went with `y` because i wanted to re-acquaint with what it does

```
‚úî Added script 'chromatic' to package.json
You can now run it here or in CI with 'npm run chromatic' or 'yarn chromatic'.

‚Ñπ Your project token was added to the script via the --project-token flag.
If you're running Chromatic via continuous integration, we recommend setting
the CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN environment variable in your CI environment.
You can then remove the --project-token from your package.json script.
```

![Screenshot of successful first build](./README/Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 1.04.09 PM.png)
![Screenshot of screen informing me how to capture a change](./README/Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 1.07.40 PM.png)

This line gets added when I publish without changes

```
No changes found in the Storybook you published. Make a UI tweak and publish again to continue the demo.
```

I'd really like a "Skip" option or "show me this later" option when I'm just trying to get set up. As it stands, I'm not allowed to proceed until I do this. But I don't have anything that I want to *change* at the moment.

I have personally aborted this screen on many occasions.

Here, I will add an arbitrary story just to get it to pass.

Might be worth mentioning, at this point, that I can push anything I want. Can I do it without commiting?

---

Just pushed a build without committing. I've never thought about doing that but totally makes sense. I'm using Chromatic to update the baseline.

## Notes

### Interactions as Chromatic light
- I'm still forming a boundary around what Storybook is without Chromatic. And what the value is for developers
- Interactions changes the value proposition quite a bit
  - can i test navigation?
