# storybook-nextjs

A setup run-thru of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) in a stock [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app

## Steps

### Next.js

[Instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs)

- run `npx create-next-app --ts --use-npm`
  - npm because i prefer it to yarn
  - typescript because i thought it might add a level of configuration complication
  - **This will create a new project directory. There isn't an `in-place` option.**
- `cd storybook-nextjs`
- `npm run dev`
- `visit http://localhost:3000`

### Storybook

[Instructions](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install)

- run `npx sb init` _in_ project root
  - this makes sense whene there is an existing project (like this). it's not perfectly clear if I were using Storybook to build out a new, single component on design system
  - <mark>are there starters for projects like individual components and design systems for folks who want to use Storybook as their primary artifact?</mark>

> audited 1830 packages in 8.289s
> 236 packages are looking for funding
> run `npm fund` for details

> found 40 vulnerabilities (30 moderate, 10 high)
> run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details

- this feels like:
  - a LOT of dependencies
  - a lot of introduced vulnerabilities
- run `npm audit fix`
  - does not resolve vulnerabilities

> fixed 0 of 40 vulnerabilities in 1830 scanned packages
> 40 vulnerabilities required manual review and could not be updated

- `npm run storybook`
  - ‚úÖ works!
- documentation jumps directly into ["What's a story?"](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story)
  - because we used a generator, there are LOTS of new files. i think a document on the structure is warrented. even if just a link to another doc
  - items to cover
    - `.storybook`
      - `main.js`
      - `preview.js`
    - `stories`
      - `...stories`
      - `assets`
      - `introduction.mdx`
  - interesting time to cover the difference between stories and markdown
  - Component Story Format (CSF) should be a link to [docs/{library}/api/csf](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf)
  - `alt` tags for images are sparce
    - consider "Screenshot of Storybook in browser. The sidebar has Story Button/Primary selected. The main are of the site shows the "Canvas" tab with the rendered button"
  - slight divergance in documentation demo and generated code

_documentation_

```tsx
// Button.stories.ts | Button.stories.tsx

import React from "react";

import { Story, Meta } from "@storybook/react";

import { Button } from "./Button";

export default {
  component: Button,
  title: "Components/Button",
} as Meta;

//üëá We create a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù of how args map to rendering
const Template: Story<ButtonProps> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});

Primary.args = {
  primary: true,
  label: "Button",
};
```

_SB generated_

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ComponentStory, ComponentMeta } from "@storybook/react";

import { Button } from "./Button";

export default {
  title: "Example/Button",
  component: Button,
  argTypes: {
    backgroundColor: { control: "color" },
  },
} as ComponentMeta<typeof Button>;

const Template: ComponentStory<typeof Button> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {
  primary: true,
  label: "Button",
};
```
